For R0 and trait trajectories, rows are values along the temperature gradient (see Temperature Trajectories directory for files with the specific sequence for each model) and columns are MCMC iteration.

Trait codes:
NOTE: not every trait appears in every model
a = biting rate (1/day, often measured as inverse of gonotrophic cycle duration)
b = vector competence (proportion of infected that successfully transmit)
bc = vector competence (proportion of exposed that successfully transmit)
c = vector competence (proportion of exposed that are successfully infected)
e2a = egg-to-adult survival (proportion)
EFD = fecundity (as eggs per female per day)
EFOC = fecundity (as eggs per female per oviposition cycle)
EPR = fecundity (as eggs per raft - needs to be multiplied by proportion ovipositing [pO] to get eggs per female per oviposition cycle)
EV = egg viability (proportion hatching)
lf = lifespan (days)
MDR = mosquito development rate (1/day)
mu = daily mortality (probability or proportion; AngaPfal model only)
nLR = number of larvae per raft (# / 1000, fit needs to be * 1000/298.63 to turn into a proportion hatching ~= EV; CxanRRVx model only)
PDR = pathogen development rate (1/day)
pO = proportion of females ovipositing
pRH = proportion of egg rafts that hatch (proportion; CxanRRVx model only)
R0 = predicted R0 (transmission potential) 
T = temperature sequence, which varies between models
